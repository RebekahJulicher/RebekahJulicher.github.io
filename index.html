			<text id="aboutcontent">
				I'm the third oldest in a big Arizona family of ten kids. My dad worked at Microchip Technology for the 
				majority of my life growing up, while my mom chose to stay home and homeschool myself and most of my siblings.
				<br>
				It wasn't an easy task for her, so after more of my siblings were born and my oldest brother did his rounds in a 
				charter high school, my second brother Nathan and I did the first two years of our high school education via
				FaceTime with my paternal grandmother. After some health issues got in the way, we were switched over to a 
				local community college, Central Arizona College, which turned out to be the best environment for my personal learning
				style that I had yet been in, regardless of the constant commuting between the Maricopa and Signal Peak campuses for various
				classes. <br> <br>
				Due to circumstances around my dad's job at the time, my family began the process of moving to Tucson, AZ during my
				last semester of community college. Nathan and I spent the last month or so of the semester sleeping in the empty house
				and leaving during the day when there would be tours for prospective buyers. Despite that, I graduated CAC with a 
				3.93 GPA, my highschool education out of the way, and an Associate of Science degree under my belt. 
				<br> <br>
				My undergraduate studies were interrupted midway through the first semester by COVID, but one starter job, two internships,
				two semesters as a TA, and one Outstanding Senior award later, I graduated University of Arizona with a B.S in Computer
				Science, a minor in ISTA (Information Science, Technology, and Art), and a 3.87 GPA.
				<br> <br>
				I am currently in the process of applying to masters programs to focus in Human-Computer Interaction.
				<br> <br>
				Most of my more impressive professional work has been during internships and is for internal use only 
				and HR is unlikely to release it for portfolio use), but I have some neat personal projects and art
				challenges I do between internships.
