				Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. 
				So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can 
				gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. 
				He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take 
				this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold. <br> <br>

				Hello. We understand you require Real-Time Combat Instructives. <br> <br>
				This is a BRAINVAULT Sigma-ACTIUM-X Cranial Dreadnought (Invictus Type). It is a fortress 
				for your skull. Your skull is now a mighty bastion. You can break anything with your skull. 
				The only limit is your spine. Relax. The lights will speak for you. Your hands are your 
				eyes now. Look around. You find hand-to-hand combat relaxing. The lights will attract the 
				enemy. Help them to relax as well. You will feel the effect of a CAREGRAVER Gamma-LYSANDER-IV 
				Health Enforcer (Frontline Variant). Your enemies do not have a skull fortress. Their 
				skulls are like meadows. Play in the meadows. Gather the flowers from the meadows. Gather 
				them with electrokinetic trauma. Smell the flowers. Isn't that nice? <br> <br>
				You are safe in your skullfort.
