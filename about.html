                <text id="aboutcontent">
                    I'm Rebekah Julicher, and I'm a Computer Science major who got so fed up with the user interfaces around me that
                    I went to grad school for a masters degree in HCI out of spite.
                    <br><br>
                    I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Arizona in CS with a minor in Information Science, Technology, 
                    and Art (basically where they shoved all the web dev, game dev, and classes that *almost* fit into CS, computer engineering, 
                    software engineering, or electrical engineering, but not quite.) While I was there, I did time for two semesters as a teaching 
                    assistant for a class in Object-Oriented Programming, one of which was done while balancing an internship in business 
                    applications at Tucson Electric Power. After I finished that, I decided I hadn't yet seen enough of the hardware 
                    side of things, so I did about a year as Rain Bird Corporation's first ever intern, working in firmware with a focus 
                    on virtual simulators for the LXIVM, LXIVM-Pro, and LXME-2 irrigation controllers.
                    <br><br>
                    As I finished up my time at UofA, I became the departmental recipient of the Outstanding Senior Award of Fall 2022,
                    and graduated with a strong 3.87 GPA.
                    <br><br>
                    A year and three car batteries later, I'm currently studying in the MHCI program at Carnegie-Mellon University in 
                    Pittsburgh, and I'd like to think I'm doing alright with it so far. I'm far from home, but people do crazy things 
                    when they hate inaccessible and unsafe interfaces enough. If you want to get in touch or hear me rant about 
                    full-touch-screen car consoles, drop me a message!
