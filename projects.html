					MCXX-II, forthcoming. <br> 
					Recorded by Underscribe Shipal <br> <br>
					Thus did the Shadow of Earth slay the Titan Vanguard Zavala. <br> 
					<span id="dotdotdot0">...</span><span class="moreContent" id="more0">
					<br>
					As recorded by the enshrined Scribe Shagac, the Vanguard of Earth 
					requested mercy, and their request was denied. Thus the Titan 
					Zavala was permitted a final day to consider his perfidy before his death. <br> <br>
					So the Titan Zavala went to the Human known as Suraya Hawthorne 
					and said, "Suraya Hawthorne, will you play a game of checkers with me?" <br> <br>
					Suraya Hawthorne agreed, and so the two played twenty-seven games of 
					checkers, and listened to the music of bagpipes and synthesizers, 
					and dined upon Earth delicacies such as nuggets of chicken and the 
					beer of roots. <br> <br>
					"Titan Zavala," said Suraya Hawthorne as Earth's sun rose upon their 
					latitude, "There will never again be a checkersmaster of your like." <br> <br>
					"No, Suraya," said Titan Zavala. "You must become a greater checkersmaster 
					than even me, if you are to lead the resistance." <br> <br>
					Thus the Titan Vanguard did not meet his final death alone. And Suraya 
					Hawthorne was slain at a later date. <br> <br>
					^ Note to Underscribe Shipal: Very good. This is entirely credible.
