			<text id="aboutcontent">
				I'm the third oldest in a big Arizona family of ten kids. My dad worked at Microchip Technology for the 
				majority of my life growing up, while my mom chose to stay home and homeschool myself and most of my siblings.
				<br>
				After more of my siblings were born, my second brother and I did the first two years 
				of our high school education via FaceTime with my paternal grandmother. After some health issues got in the way, we were
				switched over to a local community college, Central Arizona College. During this period, I balanced competitive robotics,
				a scouting program, and occasional freelance commission-based laser work with my academics. <br> <br>
				Due to circumstances around my dad's job at the time, my family began the process of moving to Tucson, AZ during my
				last semester of community college. My brother and I spent the last month or so of the semester sleeping in the empty house
				and leaving during the day when there would be tours for prospective buyers. Despite that, I graduated CAC with a 
				3.93 GPA, my highschool education out of the way, and an Associate of Science degree under my belt. 
				<br> <br>
				My undergraduate studies were interrupted midway through the first semester by COVID, but one starter job, two internships,
				two semesters as a TA, and one Outstanding Senior award later, I graduated University of Arizona with a B.S in Computer
				Science, a minor in ISTA (Information Science, Technology, and Art), and a 3.87 GPA.
				<br> <br>
				I am currently in the process of applying to masters programs to focus in Human-Computer Interaction.
				<br> <br>
				<b>Most of my more impressive professional work has been during internships and is for internal use only 
				(HR is unlikely to release it for portfolio use), but I have some neat personal projects and art
				I've done between internships on my projects page.</b>
